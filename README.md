## Running Python notebooks locally

To run the iPython notebooks on your local machine, follow these steps:

- Ensure a Python installation. Preferably, use a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html). The notebooks were developed using Python 3.10.11. 
- Install the requirements to your Python installation using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. If using a virtual environment, ensure you have activated it first.
- Run the notebook server using `jupyter notebook`.
- Open the notebook you whish to work on using the graphical interface.
