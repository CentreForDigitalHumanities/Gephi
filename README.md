## Course description
The Centre for Digital Humanities will introduce you to the core concepts of network analysis in this interactive workshop. Following this introduction, youâ€™ll go hands-on with open-source network visualization sofware Gephi and the Python package NetworkX to study a large-scale social media conversation. After this hands-on session, you will be able to independently conduct a network research on a large dataset.

Networks are all around us. The relationship between friends on Facebook, money flows between businesses, or characters in a novel: they can all be studied as parts of a network. These types of analyses can open up a wealth of new perspectives, granting insights into the dynamics of social and cultural phenomena that could not be discovered through traditional methods.

Getting started with network analysis can be daunting, however. This course for humanities staff aims to take away the initial hurdles of data collection, preparation and visualization by offering an accessible entry into the world of networks. In this interactive workshop you will be introduced to the core concepts of network analysis, after which you will go hands-on with open-source network visualization software Gephi to study a large-scale social media conversation. You will learn how to detect communities, find important actors within the debate and filter for relevant data.

The workshop continues by exploring networks in Python using the package NetworkX. Topics include creating and manipulating graphs, importing and exporting from Gephi, and network analysis.
