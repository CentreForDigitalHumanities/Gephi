## Running the notebooks

### Google Colab (recommended)
Navigate to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and login with your Google account.

Select `File -> Open Notebook -> GitHub`.

In the search box, enter *CentreForDigitalHumanities Gephi* and press the search button.

Several notebooks should show up, select *python/0 - Introduction.ipynb*. 

After opening, select `File -> Save a copy in Drive`. You now have your own copy of the course materials that you can execute and alter to your hearts desire.

### Running Python notebooks locally

To run the iPython notebooks on your local machine, follow these steps:

- Ensure a Python installation. Preferably, use a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html). The notebooks were developed using Python 3.10.11. 
- Install the requirements to your Python installation using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. If using a virtual environment, ensure you have activated it first.
- Run the notebook server using `jupyter notebook`.
- Open the notebook you wish to work on using the graphical interface.
