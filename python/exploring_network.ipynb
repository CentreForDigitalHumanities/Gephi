    "\n",
    "2. **`\\w+`**: \n",
    "   - `\\w` is a shorthand character class that matches any \"word\" character. Specifically, it matches:\n",
    "     - Any letter (uppercase or lowercase),\n",
    "     - Any digit (0-9),\n",
    "     - The underscore (`_`).\n",
    "   - The `+` following `\\w` means \"one or more\" of the preceding character class. So, `\\w+` will match one or more word characters.\n",

    "The regular expression `\\#\\w+` matches any string that starts with a `#` symbol, followed by one or more word characters (letters, digits, or underscores).\n",
